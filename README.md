# Initial Design
![image](images/UI.png)
- this is a very rough visual, the way it already looks is diverged a little bit

# Features
## Description
- This website should provide an frontend interface for interacting with a library account.
  - accounts should have to be signed into via some authentication method
  - accounts should be backed by some database to keep track of information about checked out books
- it should allow you to search for new books and allow you to check them out
- it should list the books you have checked out in a way that lets you edit information about this book
  - check the book back in
  - viewing general book details
  - how long you've had this book
  - etc..
  - NOTE: These edit features might be buttons somehow grouped with the book entry
